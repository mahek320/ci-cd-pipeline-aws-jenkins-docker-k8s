**Solution**<br>
   
i. We will create three EC2 instances (**Git_Inst, Jenkins, and Tomcat**) on AWS, using **Amazon Linux** as the server. The **Git and Tomcat instances** will have an **instance type of t2.micro**, while the **Jenkins server** will use **t2.medium**. <br> 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f14348df-4934-4ba8-afe2-cdd2cd093684)<br><br>

ii. We have made a new security group and gave access to the ports below.<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5ba9bec-8153-4d30-a6f2-088467306fdc)<br><br>

iii. We will now connect to the terminal of Git instance, set the hostname to GitInstance and install git.<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea8c119-3bd1-43fb-a149-ddf03e447cdf)<br><br>


iv. We will now establish SSH connection using ssh-keygen. We use ssh-keygen in DevOps to generate secure SSH keys for authenticating and encrypting connections to remote servers.<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad1ebb7-b7ce-4763-9ff5-0050ccb21b27)<br><br>


v. After getting the public key we will paste it in the git repository under settings >> SSH and GPG keys >> Add new SSH Key<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af0dd08f-6518-4daf-b226-07dfd5156c84)<br><br>

vi. In the Git_Inst terminal, we will first initialize Git. Once initialized, we will successfully push the files to the Git repository <br>
